Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?


Java is a pass by Value language.With primitive types, Java copy value => don't affect origin. With objects, it copy memory address so both variables points to same object.

after swap  only change copy off refences => objects not change
changeTitle change attribute of origin object so title will be change.
