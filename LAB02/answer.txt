- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 

No, when use constructor like that, signature of constructor will be the same like DigitalVideoDisc(String). Example, When we declare DigitalVideoDisc("Hoangphuc"), JAVA
can't understand "Hoangphuc" is title or category.
